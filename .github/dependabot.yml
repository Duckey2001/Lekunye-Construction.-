To get started with Dependabot version updates, this configuration file needs to specify the package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located. 

For detailed information about all available configuration options and their possible values, please refer to the [Dependabot documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file).

## Configuration Details:

- `version`: This specifies the version of the Dependabot configuration. In this case, it's set to version 2.
- `updates`: This is an array that contains the settings for each package ecosystem to be updated. For each ecosystem, you need to specify the package-ecosystem, directory, and schedule.
  - `package-ecosystem`: This should be replaced with the name of the package ecosystem you want Dependabot to update. Refer to the documentation for possible values.
  - `directory`: This specifies the location of the package manifests for the specified package ecosystem.
  - `schedule`: This sets the frequency at which Dependabot will check for updates. In this example, it's set to "weekly".

By configuring this file properly, you can automate the process of keeping dependencies up-to-date, ensuring your project stays secure and up-to-date with the latest releases.
